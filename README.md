# Branch Overview
This is the ___unstable___ branch, meaning the code you see here is kinda "see only" because you aren't meant to run this code at all since it isnt tested nor finished!

# Currently Doing...
Currently organizing my code, i started using libraries, make systems, adopted naming conventions and error handling!

So heres the naming convention im using:  
    
    Thing                          | What case              | Example
    :----------------------------: | :---------------------:| :---------------:
    Functions & Structs & Macros   | Pascal                 | ThisIsAFunction
    Variables                      | Camel                  | iAmAVariable
    (shared) Constants             | Caps + Snake           | SHARED_CONSTANT_VALUE
    File Pointers                  | Camel + f at the start | fFilePointer

    (keep in mind im still updating the code so the naming conventions don't aply to ALL the code, but they are mostly present on the new libraries)  

# Documentation?
    No documentation. Its unstable for a reason  
    However, __IF__ there is a ``docs/`` directory in the branch, don't asume that it is finished
